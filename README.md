## Software Bootcamp Team 2020 In-flight Safety Demonstration

Ladies and gentlemen (and non-binary individuals), as we are about to take off, please direct your full attention to this readme before you push any code. Failure to do so may result in a turbulent flight.

When the "Your branch is behind..." sign illuminates after **"git status"**, make sure you **"git pull"** any changes from the repository. When you are completed working and would like to save it in your working directory, **add, commit, and push** it to the github repository. Insert the files you do not want to push in the .gitignore file, and "git add .", then "git commit -m "[insert message here]", finally "git push". We suggest you push your code often and with not too many changes as to decrease the possibility of conflicts on this flight.

There are several emergency exits located on this repository **(git rm -r File-Name, git rm --cached file.txt, git stash)**. Please take this time to familiarize yourself with the Git commands. In some cases the nearest exit may be located in this cheat sheet **https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf** If we need to evacuate the repository, floor-level lighting will guide you towards the slack channel that will allow you to DM us. Each exit is equipped with an inflatable slide which may be used for fun because....slides....duh.

If you are seated in the **master branch directory**, please read the special instructions card located below on merge conflicts and how to resolve them. If you do not wish to perform these tasks please stay in your own branch until Ryan or I have taught you to merge code.

We remind you that this is a **judgement free zone** so any questions, comments, and concerns will be allowed at any time. We wish you all an enjoyable flight!
